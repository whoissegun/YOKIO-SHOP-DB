# YOKIO-SHOP-DB
A dummy database for an E-commerce company
I used MySQL and Python to create a dummy database for an E-commerce company.

I implemented Python to:
- Generate csv files containing data for the 'products' and 'orders' tables. I downloaded 'people-1000.csv' (that is, the csv  file containing the data for the        
  customer table) online
- Extract data from the csv files and insert the data to their respective tables
- Delete records from tables by specifying either the customer id, order id, or product id

I used MySQL to:
- Create the tables for the database
- Perform database analysis whenever I encountered problems with performing operations with Python
- Incorporate MySQL syntax along with Python code
